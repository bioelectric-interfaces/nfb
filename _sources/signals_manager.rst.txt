This window is used to adjust the spatial filters using a variety of methods. It is also possible
to edit the temporary filter options. When you click the “Open” button for the signal of the matching line, you will
open a window for the corresponding column of the analysis (SSD, CSP, ICA). Each type of analysis produces the
decomposition of raw signal into several components from which you can build spatial filter for selection or rejection
corresponding components. The following describes the window for different types of analysis.
