Organisation:
-------------
There are separate images for each session (scalp, source, sham)
These are located in the subfolders 0, 1, 2.
The subfolders are randomised between sessions across participants. i.e. scalp NFB could use images from subfolder 0, 1, or 2.
Participants only ever see each image once. Therefore each subfolder will be used for one session per participant.
Each subfolder contains <x> images.
Each image is horizontally flipped/mirrored.
Each participant only sees either the original or mirrored image once (randomised)
The script image_mirror.py was used to mirror each image
